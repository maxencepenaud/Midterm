#Here we are trying to find every word in the sentence starting with "C" and finishing with "jeb". Besides every step I explained what I was doing for better understanding: ﻿It first removes specified punctuation from the text to ensure that words are not incorrectly concatenated, which could potentially miss patterns.The text is then split into individual words based on spaces.﻿The function iterates over each word, checking if it starts with "C" and ends with "jeb". If a word meets these criteria, the match counter is incremented.Finally, the function returns the total count of matches found.
